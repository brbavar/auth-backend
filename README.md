This is the backend of my auth application, [Authogonal](https://authogonal.netlify.app/). Authogonal's code is organized in accordance with the MVC architecture. You can find the implementation of the Model in the [`models`](https://github.com/brbavar/auth-backend/tree/main/models) directory, and that of the Controller in the [`controllers`](https://github.com/brbavar/auth-backend/tree/main/controllers) directory. As for the View, that is just the frontend, which is stored in a separate repo: [`auth-frontend`](https://github.com/brbavar/auth-frontend).
